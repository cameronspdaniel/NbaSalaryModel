Final Project Proposal 

Group members: Prabhdeep Kaur, Bhavan Bagri, Cameron Daniel, Dustin Markan, Eric Ziyue Song

Dataset: NBA Player Salary Dataset (2017 - 2018)
	 NBA Player Metrics (2017 - 2018)
	 (Joined with names)

Objectives: Train models that correlates games stats to yearly salary paid to players.


Outline:
- ML model that takes in game stats (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, 2P FG percentage etc.) as training points.

- Build page that takes user input on stats then runs it through the model; spits out the expected salary for the player.

- Weights on what are the most important stats for players in different positions to earn more money (by delivering better game performence).
